UPDATE NOV 8:
Looking at 7000 watershed (starting position, see notradeat700sample.png)
score seems to be consistent. Don't have access to microsoft Excel right 
now, but capture and model.js output both indicate same usage & fish points.
Testing trade sample.
Bizzarely, this also matches. It could be that the Excel sheet had been
modified accidentally at some point prior to tracking to make the trades 
incorrect.
Test case at 7000 no trades and trade sample ( see tradesample.png ) passes.
The sample trade set is designed to stress the operations as much as I can,
Having multiple inflows to one region, having one region be an inflow and an
outflow at the same time, and selling more water than the location initially 
posesses. Trade system is not yet complete, as overselling still has no checks.
